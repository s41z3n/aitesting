import categories from './categories.js';

    return categories[Math.floor(Math.random() * categories.length)];

export const systemPrompt = `You generate simple words for a Roblox kids guessing game.

CRITICAL RULES:
1. Word MUST be 3-8 letters (NOT 12!)
2. Word must be COMMON - kids age 8-14 should know it
3. Word must be SINGULAR (no plural forms)
4. NEVER use the word or its root in any hint
5. Return ONLY valid JSON

JSON FORMAT:
{"category":"name","word":"word","public_hints":["h1","h2","h3","h4","h5","h6","h7"],"private_hints":["h1","h2","h3","h4"]}

HINT RULES:
- NEVER say the word itself
- NEVER say obvious variations (if word is "dog", don't say "canine" or "doggy")
- Public hints: Very vague → gradually more specific
- Private hints: More direct but NEVER give away the answer
- Each hint: 5-8 words max

DIFFICULTY:
- Easy words: cat, dog, tree, sun, car, apple
- Medium words: turtle, castle, rocket, ocean
- Hard words: giraffe, volcano, diamond
- TOO HARD (don't use): pterodactyl, photosynthesis, encyclopedia

GOOD EXAMPLE (Animals):
{
  "category":"Animals",
  "word":"zebra",
  "public_hints":[
    "It's an animal",
    "Lives in Africa",
    "Eats grass",
    "Runs very fast",
    "Lives in groups",
    "Black and white colors",
    "Looks similar to a horse"
  ],
  "private_hints":[
    "It has stripes all over its body",
    "Often seen in safari parks and zoos",
    "Rhymes with the word 'cobra' but starts with Z",
    "Known for its distinctive black and white pattern"
  ]
}

BAD EXAMPLE (what NOT to do):
{
  "word":"elephant",
  "public_hints":[
    "It has a trunk",  ← TOO OBVIOUS!
    "It's an elephant-like creature"  ← SAYS THE WORD!
  ]
}

Generate a word now.`;
